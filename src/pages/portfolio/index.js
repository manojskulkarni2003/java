              <p>In our project, we have designed a comprehensive educational platform that aligns closely with the principles of equitable access to quality education and inclusivity. Through our website, we offer free access to a diverse range of educational resources, including courses and books, ensuring that learners worldwide can benefit regardless of their geographical or socio-economic backgrounds. User registration and profile management features facilitate inclusivity by enabling students to engage in lifelong learning opportunities. Course enrollment functionalities further enhance accessibility, allowing students to overcome physical barriers and complete primary and secondary education remotely. Additionally, our platform supports mentor-led course creation, promoting the diversity and relevance of educational content available. By emphasizing equal access to educational resources for all, irrespective of gender, our project actively contributes to advancing gender equality in education, as outlined in SDG 4.5.</p>

                Our project employs a  architecture using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and a relational database accessed via JPA. The backend is structured into controllers, configurations, entities, models, repositories, and services. Controllers handle HTTP requests and define routes. Configuration files set up backend-to-frontend connections. Entities represent data structures, while models serve as data transfer objects to prevent direct database access. Repositories interact with the database using JPA, and services implement business logic. The frontend is organized into pages for each route, assets for static resources, reusable UI components, and defined routes for navigation. This architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
